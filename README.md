# uno-game
 This is an implementation in JAVA of the classic card game UNO.
>2 - 10 players.
>Deck:
	19 blue   cards - 0 to 9; 
	19 red    cards - 0 to 9;
	19 yellow cards - 0 to 9;
	19 green  cards - 0 to 9;
	8 “Draw Two” cards- two of each color;
	8 “Skip” cards- two of each color;
	8 “Reverse” cards- two of each color;
	4 “Wild” cards;
	4 “Wild Draw Four” cards.
>7 cards are dealt out to each player in the beginning of the game.
>A player may always draw a card from the deck.
>If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck.
>In a two-player game, the Reverse card acts like the Skip card.
